# weather-app-client
Web client to interact with weather data

Consumes data via [weather-app-server](https://github.com/thomkrillis/weather-app-server)

## Requirements
- Yarn or npm

## Next Steps for Production-Ready

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
1. From the root directory run `yarn install`
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add `PORT=3001` (defaults to 3000 which conflicts with the server)
1. Run `yarn start` to start the application


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
